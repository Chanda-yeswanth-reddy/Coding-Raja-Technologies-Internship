Fraud Detection Machine Learning Project
Project Description:
This project is aimed at developing a robust model for the detection of fraudulent transactionswithin a financial dataset.
The project's objective is to enhance security and minimize financial losses by identifying potentially fraudulent activities.
Steps:
1.Data Collection: Gather transaction data with key features.
2.Data Preprocessing: Clean, handle missing values, checking the dataset if it is balanced.
3.Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features for fraud detection.
4.Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize data patterns .
5.Model Selection: Choose the best classification algorithm  Random Forest as the datasheet is unbalanced.
6.Model Training: Train the model on preprocessed data.
7.Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
